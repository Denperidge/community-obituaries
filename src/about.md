## About this website
This website's source code is available at the  [community-obituaries repo on GitHub](https://github.com/Denperidge/community-obituaries). It was originally built to help preserve the lives of the people lost in Antwerp, Belgium's local queer/trans community.

The website is designed to be lightweight, accessible and easy to redeploy (for people within the same community) + customise (for people who wish to create obituaries for people in their own communities).

This website isn't much, but I hope it's something. May those that didn't make it - whether it be through an accident, natural death or suicide - rest in peace.
